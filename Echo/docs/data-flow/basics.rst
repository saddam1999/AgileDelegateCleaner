The Basics
==========

What are Data Flow Graphs?
--------------------------

Data flow graphs are graphs that encode the dependencies between objects, instructions or components. They can be used to do dependency analysis, or 

Consider the following excerpt of a function written in a fictional stack-based language:

.. code-block:: csharp

    push 1
    push 2
    add
    store v1

From the example above, we can see that two constants are pushed onto the stack, then an addition is applied, and the result is stored into ``v1``.

A data flow graph would model this as the following:

.. image:: img/add.png
    :alt: A data flow graph encoding the data dependencies of the provided sample code.

In the graph, every outgoing edge node encodes a data dependency to another node.

Data Flow Graph Models
----------------------

There are three main classes that are used to model DFGs. Given a ``TContents`` type, representing the type of data to store in each node of the DFG, Echo defines the following classes:

- ``DataFlowNode<TContents>``: A single node, wrapping an instruction or component.
- ``DataDependency<TContents>``: A stack or variable value that an instruction or component depends on, that keeps track of a collection of data sources.
- ``DataSource<TContents>``: A single data source referenced by a ``DataDependency<TContents>``. This object translates to a single edge in the data flow graph.
- ``DataFlowGraph<TContents>``: A collection of nodes and their dependencies.

These classes implement the ``INode``, ``IEdge`` and ``IGraph`` interfaces, and work therefore with all kinds of generic graph algorithms and export features.


Data flow nodes 
---------------

Nodes expose their direct dependencies using the following properties:

- ``StackDependencies``: A collection of stack slots that the node depends on.
- ``VariableDependencies``: A collection of variables the node depends on.

These properties are collections of type ``DataDependency<TContents>`` and are fully mutable, and can be used to add or remove dependencies between nodes. Every ``DataDependency<TContents>`` represents a single value with potentially multiple data sources. As a result, every stack value that an instruction pops is assigned exactly one ``DataDependency<TContents>`` in the ``StackDependencies`` property, and every value that was read from a variable is put in the ``VariableDependencies`` property.

Simple data dependencies
-------------------------

Taking the example on the top of this article, the ``store v1`` instruction would have one single data dependency with one data source to the ``add`` instruction, and the ``add`` instruction would have two data dependencies with both one data source to the ``push 1`` and ``push 2`` instructions respectively.

Below an example snippet that obtains the dependency instructions of the ``add`` instruction.

.. code-block:: csharp

    DataFlowGraph<T> dfg = ...
    DataFlowNode<T> add = dfg.GetNodeById(...);  

    // Obtain the symbolic values that are popped by the instruction.
    DataDependency<T> argument1 = add.StackDependencies[0];
    DataDependency<T> argument2 = add.StackDependencies[1];
    
    // Get the instructions responsible for pushing the values 
    DataFlowNode<T> argument1Source = dependency1.First().Node; // returns the node representing "push 1"
    DataFlowNode<T> argument2Source = dependency2.First().Node; // returns the node representing "push 2"


To speed up the process, Echo defines an extension methods that obtains all of the dependency data flow nodes, and sorts them in such a way that they can be evaluated in order.

.. code-block:: csharp

    DataFlowGraph<T> dfg = ...
    DataFlowNode<T> add = dfg.GetNodeById(...);  

    var dependencies = add.GetOrderedDependencies(); // returns {"push 1", "push 2"}


By default, ``GetOrderedDependencies`` traverses all edges in the data flow graph. This includes variable dependencies that were registered in the graph. If only the stack dependnecies are meant to be traversed (e.g. to get the instructions that make up a single expression), additional flags can be specified to alter the behaviour of the traversal.

.. code-block:: csharp

    DataFlowGraph<T> dfg = ...
    DataFlowNode<T> add = dfg.GetNodeById(...);  

    var dependencies = add.GetOrderedDependencies(DependencyCollectionFlags.IncludeStackDependencies);


.. warning::

    When a data dependency has multiple data sources, ``GetOrderedDependencies`` will only choose one. The method is defined to find one sequence of instructions that produce the values of the dependencies, not all possible sequences of instructions. It is undefined which sequence is picked.


Multiple data sources
----------------------

It is important to note that a single data dependency might have multiple data sources (i.e. where the value might come from).

For example, if we change the example slightly to the following control flow graph:

.. image:: img/if.cfg.png
    :alt: An if statement.

The value that is popped by the ``store v1`` instruction has two possible values, and therefore two different data sources. In Echo, this would be encoded as a single ``DataDependency<TContents>`` with two possible data sources ``push 1`` and ``push 2``.  The resulting data flow graph would therefore look something like the picture below:

.. image:: img/if.dfg.png
    :alt: The associated data flow graph.

Below an example on how to find the direct dependencies of the ``store v1`` node:

.. code-block:: csharp

    DataFlowGraph<T> dfg = ...
    DataFlowNode<T> storeV1 = dfg.GetNodeById(...);  

    // Obtain the symbolic value that is popped by the instruction.
    var dependency = storeV1.StackDependencies[0];

    // Print out the possible data sources for this value:
    foreach (DataSource<T> source in dependency)
        Console.WriteLine(sourceNode.Node.Contents);
