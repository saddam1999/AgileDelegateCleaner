DFG Construction
================

Constructing data flow graphs from a list of instructions can be done by constructing a control flow graph using the ``SymbolicFlowGraphBuilder``. This class generates both a control flow graph, as well as a data flow graph as a by-product. See the section ``Symbolic CFG Construction`` for more details.
