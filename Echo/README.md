Echo
====

Echo is an experimental generic, static analysis, symbolic execution and emulation framework, that aims to help out with binary code analysis for a variety of platforms.

Echo is released under the LGPLv3 license.

Main Features
-------------
- Control flow analysis
    - Create static and symbolic flow graphs
    - Dominator analysis
    - Serialize into scoped flow blocks or a list of instructions
- Data flow analysis
    - Create data flow graphs
    - Inspect stack and variable dependencies of instructions.
- Unified generic API.
    - Serialize any kind of graph to the dot file format.
    - Adding a new platform for flow analysis requires minimal effort


Supported platforms:

| Architecture | Back-end                                                | Control Flow | Data Flow | Purity Classification | Emulation |

Compiling
---------

Echo can be built using `dotnet build`, or any IDE that is capable of building .NET Standard 2.0 projects (such as Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider).

Not all projects need to be built for a working binary to be produced. Only the core libraries found in `src/Core` are required to be built. Any other project, such as the platform-specific back-ends in the `src/Platforms` directory and the test projects in `test/`, is optional and can be unloaded safely.
